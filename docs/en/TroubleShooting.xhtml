<h1>DocCharConvert: Trouble Shooting</h1>

<h2>Garbled Data</h2>
<p>Some of the data may be converted correctly, other data isn't. This probably 
means that you have got the encoding specified wrongly for either the Input or 
Output files. Check the original source of the data and the documentation for 
the specific converter that you are using. Internally, the text is all converted 
to Unicode before it is processed. If the encoding that you are using has codes 
that cannot be translated to Unicode then these may fail to be converted 
correctly. Old files created with legacy pre-Unicode fonts should probably be 
converted as Windows-1252 with the Output set to UTF-8. </p>
<p>Some legacy fonts use code points that are undefined in Windows-1252. 
In this case you may want to try the RawBytes encoding.</p>
<h2>OpenOffice doesn't convert fonts specified in Word Documents</h2>
<p>Sometimes if a document was forwarded in Microsoft word, the converter does 
not identify the text to convert properly, even though the font is selected 
correctly. Try openning the document in OpenOffice and resaving it from 
OpenOffice before you do the conversion.</p>
<h2>OpenOffice crashes</h2>
<p>The interface that DocCharConvert uses to process documents in OpenOffice 
is not very stable. Occasionally it crashes. DocCharConvert will attempt to 
restart it automatically, but it does not always work. If all else fails you 
can save the text to a plain text file and convert it that way - this is also 
much faster.</p>

<h2>TECkit on AMD64</h2>
<p>The JNI supplied for TECkit will only work on 32 bit Windows and 32 bit Linux. 
A 64 bit version is available in the Converter directory for Linux, but you will 
have to rename <tt>libTecKitJni.amd64.so</tt> to <tt>libTecKitJni.so</tt>. 
For other platforms you may need to build TECkit for yourself. The TECkit 
source code is available from 
<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/">Subversion on scripts.sil.org</a>.
</p>
<h2>Other Problems and Bugs</h2>
<p>For other problems and bugs please send an email to 
devel&#x40;thanlwinsoft.org.
Please try to be as explicit as possible in describing your problem. 
If it is a case of incorrect conversion, then it is very hard to diagnose 
problems unless I can reproduce it.
If possible, please send some example files (though not too big please!) that 
illustrate the problem.
